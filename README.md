This repository contains the lists of modules (as well as states, runners, engines, etc) which will get removed from Salt.

A file can fall into one of three categories.

1. Files that are core to Salt and will remain in the Salt codebase (core-modules.txt)
2. Files that will be moved out of the Salt codebase but continue to be maintained by the Salt Core Team (core-ext-modules.txt)
3. Files that will be moved out into a dump repository and will no longer be maintained by the Salt Core Team (community-ext-modules.txt)
4. Files which serve no purpose on Salt's runtime, for example, test related files, which can and should be created when
   running the test suite, if need be. (delete-modules.txt)
5. Files that are needed for for the test suite, these are things we want
   remain in the salt codebase but also want to preserve community extensions
   dump repository (test-support.txt)

We'll use `git filter-repo` to migrate modules to a separate repositoy while
retaining their git history. Once the migration has taken place, we'll do a
`git rm` against the main salt repository.


Install filter-repo (Debian)
```
sudo apt-get install -y git-filter-repo
```

Now make a fresh clone and run filter repo. Starting in the root of this repository.

```
FILESDIR=$(pwd)
cd /tmp
git clone git@github.com:saltstack/salt.git community-extensions
cd community-extensions
git filter-repo --dry --paths-from-file=$FILESDIR/community-ext-modules.txt
```

If eveything looks good... Send it!

```
git filter-repo --paths-from-file=$FILESDIR/community-ext-modules.txt --paths-from-file=$FILESDIR/test-support.txt
```

Now we can remove the migrated files from the salt repo.

```
cd ~/src/salt
git rm -- $(cat $FILESDIR/core-ext-modules.txt)
git commit -m 'Removing core extension modules'
```
